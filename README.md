# treebank-data

This folder contains the treebank data of all the sources that were created during the work on the **Digital Hill** project.

Each source has its own folder, in the case of Plutarch there are two subfolders, one for *The Life of Pericles* and one for *The Life of Themistocles*.

Each file has the .xml format.
